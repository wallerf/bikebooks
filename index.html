                            <p class="card-text">Two Wheels Bookkeeping is a cross-generational collaboration born out of a desire to provide real, impactful support for small businesses, arts organizations, and non-profits. Our two bookkeepers are Fletcher: the driving force behind Two Wheels, and Kevin: the expert and guiding light.

                                <br>
                                Fletcher is a data specialist with a background in astronomical science. Having previously worked in ledgers of light to understand how stars and galaxies tick, he is now applying his data skills to financial ledgers so he can better understand how organizations and communities tick.
                                When not carefully analyzing and maintaining your records, he can be found swimming at the Banfield dock, volunteering at the Oaklands Community Center, and riding his 30+yo Norco mountian bike around town.

                                <br>
                                Kevin is a retired banker with decades of financial and small business experience throughout Western Canada. When not at his desk, he can be found in his woodshop, listening to jazz flute, or taking motorcycle trips up and down the pacific coast.
